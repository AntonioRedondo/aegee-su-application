# Application for AEGEE Summer University

Website for my application for the [AEGEE](http://aegee.org) [Summer University](http://aegee.su) project. Summer Universities (SUs) are summer camps for adults lasting two weeks during summer. They are organised all around Europe happening every year an average of 70 of them.

In order to speed up the development of the website  [antonioredondo.com](http://antonioredondo.com) ([source code](https://github.com/AntonioRedondo/antonioredondo.com)) was used as starting point.

## 2017 application

For the 2017 motivation letter needed for the application I created a website in order to better giving an idea about myself and increasing the chances to be chosen. The SU I chose this year was [Hakuna Matata](http://www.projects.aegee.org/suct/su2017/show.php?su_id=BER1), through Germany, Poland and Ukraine and organised by [AEGEE-Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/AegeeBerlin) and [AEGEE-Lviv](https://www.facebook.com/AEGEE.Lviv). Even with this website, for first time in six editions I was rejected. Then, on a second round of applications I applied for [Capitals of the Lost Citizens](https://www.projects.aegee.org/suct/su2017/show.php?su_id=SOF1) through Bulgaria organised by [AEGEE-Sofia](https://www.facebook.com/AEGEESofia) where I was finally accepted.

## About AEGEE

[AEGEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEGEE) stands for Association des États Généraux des Étudiants de l'Europe and it is known as European Students' Forum in English. It is the largest trans-national, interdisciplinary student organisation in Europe. Established in 1985, AEGEE currently has around 13,000 members and almost 200 local branches (antennae) in university cities across Europe, including Russia, Turkey and the Caucasus, with a European board and head office in Brussels.

AEGEE strives for a democratic, diverse and borderless Europe, which is socially, economically and politically integrated, and values the participation of young people in its construction and development. AEGEE is a secular, non-profit organization, not linked to any political party. All projects and activities are based on voluntarily work of its members. AEGEE empowers students and young people in Europe to take an active role in society by influencing political decision makers, and it creates a space for dialogue and learning opportunities.
